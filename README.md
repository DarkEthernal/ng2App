1. Install Webstorm (free 30-day trial)
2. Download Zip file of this project and unzip it (or pull repo as an advanced user)
3. Start Webstorm and open project folder which will 'load' the project
4. In Webstorm open terminal (left down corner) and type 'npm install'
5. When the install process finishes type 'npm start'
6. Your default browser (*Chrome) should open and display the index.html

\* Due to the lack of time the app is optimized only for chrome, other browsers may work or may not.
